This project is a promotional website I created for **Kuźnia Billert**, a local blacksmithing company run by my brother-in-law.  
The goal was to build a simple and informative site that helps the company strengthen its presence online.

> ⚠️ **Note:** This version of the website is no longer live. It was temporarily replaced with a quickly assembled online store, which was created independently by the business owner himself (my brother-in-law).  
> In summer, we plan to redesign the site and build a proper e-commerce solution under this domain – possibly with a blog as well.

## ✅ Project Highlights

- 🔍 **SEO Optimization** – I made significant efforts to improve search engine visibility using semantic HTML, proper metadata, a clean structure, and other best practices.
- ♿ **Accessibility** – I followed WCAG guidelines to make the site accessible to as many users as possible.
- 🤖 **Search Engine Protection** – A `meta robots` tag is included in the project files to avoid interfering with the live version's search engine results.

## 💬 Personal Notes

This project reflects my skill level at the time it was built. I’m fully aware that the code isn't perfect and that today I would approach many things differently — cleaner structure, better performance practices, and improved semantics.  
Nonetheless, it’s a valuable piece in my portfolio that shows how I care about real-world use, search visibility, and accessibility from the start.

## 🎓 What I Learned

This project taught me more than just coding:

- 💬 **Client communication** – I learned how to talk with a real client, gather requirements, clarify expectations, and handle feedback and revisions constructively.
- 🧩 **The value of mockups** – I realized how important it is to start with a visual draft — not having one made communication and revisions more difficult. From now on, I always begin with a mockup.
- 🌐 **Real-world deployment** – I gained hands-on experience with publishing a live website and making it search engine–friendly.
- 👁️ **SEO & accessibility** – I took my first serious steps into optimizing for search engines and ensuring the site is usable for everyone.

These lessons now shape the way I approach all of my web projects.

🛠️ **Planning Phase:** A new version with an integrated store and blog is planned for summer.  
⏸️ **On Hold:** We're currently short on time, so active development is paused.
